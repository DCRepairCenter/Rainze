## [Introduction](#introduction)

You can use Copilot to get answers to coding-related questions, such as how best to code something, how to fix a bug, or how someone else's code works. For full details of what Copilot can do, see [What is GitHub Copilot?](/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot).

Instructions for using Copilot differ depending on where you are using it. This version of the quickstart is for using Copilot on the GitHub website. Click the tabs above for instructions on using Copilot in other environments.

## [Sign up for GitHub Copilot](#sign-up-for-github-copilot)

[Get started for free](https://github.com/copilot?ref_product=copilot&ref_type=engagement&ref_style=button&ref_plan=free)

To use Copilot, you’ll need a personal GitHub account with access to a Copilot plan. You can:

* Start with Copilot Free to explore limited features without subscribing to a plan.
* Upgrade to Copilot Pro or Copilot Pro+ to unlock more features, models, and request limits.

For more information about the different plans for GitHub Copilot, see [Plans for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot).

## [Asking your first question](#asking-your-first-question)

1. On GitHub, navigate to a repository and open a file.
2. Click the Copilot icon () at the top right of the file view.

   ![Screenshot of the Copilot button, highlighted with a dark orange outline, at the top of the file view.](/assets/cb-2977/images/help/copilot/copilot-button-for-file.png)
3. Type a question in the "Ask Copilot" box at the bottom of the chat panel and press `Enter`.

   For example, you could enter:

## [Get your first inline suggestion](#get-your-first-inline-suggestion)

The following example uses JavaScript, however other languages will work similarly. GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++. GitHub Copilot can also assist in query generation for databases, generating suggestions for APIs and frameworks, and can help with infrastructure as code development.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. In Visual Studio Code, create a new JavaScript (*\*.js*) file.
3. In the JavaScript file, type the following function header.

   JavaScript

   ```
   function calculateDaysBetweenDates(begin, end) {
   ```

   ```
   function calculateDaysBetweenDates(begin, end) {
   ```

   GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest an entire function body in grayed text. The exact suggestion may vary.
4. To accept the suggestion, press `Tab`.

Note

If you have access to GitHub Copilot via your organization, you won't be able to use GitHub Copilot Chat if your organization owner has disabled chat. See [Managing policies and features for GitHub Copilot in your organization](/en/copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-and-features-for-copilot-in-your-organization).

1. Open an existing code file.
2. Click **Editor** in the menu bar, then click **GitHub Copilot** then **Open Chat**.

   Copilot Chat opens in a new window.
3. In the Copilot Chat window, select the file to indicate that you want to chat about this file.

   ![Screenshot of a file selected in the Chat window. The file is highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/cb-20434/images/help/copilot/xcode-chat-about-file.png)
4. Type `what does this file do` then press `Enter`.

   Copilot's answer is displayed below your question.
5. Select a line of code in the editor.
6. In the Copilot Chat window, type `explain this line` then press `Enter`.

## [Get your first inline suggestion](#get-your-first-inline-suggestion-3)

The following example uses Swift, however other languages will work similarly.

1. Create a new file called `CalculateDays.swift`.
2. Type the following code in the new file:

   Swift

   ```
   import Foundation

   func calculateDaysBetweenDates(_ start: Date, _ end: Date)
   ```

   ```
   import Foundation

   func calculateDaysBetweenDates(_ start: Date, _ end: Date)
   ```

   GitHub Copilot adds a suggestion of code that continues this function. Suggestions are displayed in grayed text.
3. To accept the suggestion, press `Tab`.
4. Copilot will continue to make suggestions, each of which you can accept by pressing `Tab`.
