# Your terminal’s new sidekick

GitHub Copilot CLI reads, writes, and runs code where you work. Code faster, smarter, together.

[Install now](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli?locale=en-US)[See plans & pricing](http://github.com/features/copilot/plans?locale=en-US)

![A terminal window displaying GitHub Copilot CLI. The screen features a pixel art character with glasses and the message 'Welcome to GitHub COPILOT'. It shows CLI Version 0.0.1 and commit ID 36b03a6fa. Instructions explain that Copilot can write, test, and debug code from the terminal. The user is logged in as MonaLisa and connected to GitHub MCP Server. The command line path is '~/GitHubRepos/sweagentd/runtime [/_main]' with a prompt for input. Footer instructions include 'Ctrl+c Exit · Ctrl+r Collapse all'.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/5oSoYr8RQkN6yYWqSObKGQ/f08bda1d8589ab89d9adf55a732beb13/HeaderImage.webp?fm=webp)

### Less setup, more shipping

Included with Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise—keeping setup simple and costs predictable so you can focus on shipping.

### Agent-powered, GitHub-native

Execute coding tasks with an agent that knows your repositories, issues, and pull requests—all natively in your terminal.

### Collaboration with full control

Copilot CLI inherits your policies and enforces explicit approvals—so you stay in control with full transparency.

## Built for every development workflow

From rapid prototyping to legacy code navigation, Copilot CLI adapts to your unique development needs with autonomous task execution.

### Get started in any codebase instantly

Ask Copilot CLI to explore the project structure, install dependencies, and explain how everything works—all through simple conversation in your terminal.

![Screenshot of a terminal window displaying instructions for installing project dependencies. It shows the command 'cd /Users/MonaLisa/sweagentd && go mod download' to list directory contents and download Go module dependencies. Below are options to proceed: 1. Yes, 2. Yes, always allow, 3. No, and tell Copilot what to do differently (Esc).](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/4feA6TIQr2KUpNfeDPgxZk/8349be4868ecfcd58116bd43aebd7d37/1-GetStarted_0.webp)

### Leverage GitHub context and extend with your own tools

Bring context from your issues and pull requests directly to your environment, eliminating context switching. Plus, extend Copilot CLI's capabilities and context through custom MCP servers.

![Screenshot of a terminal interface showing a bot-assisted search for beginner-friendly issues in the GitHub CLI repository. The assistant guides the user through retrieving the repository URL and searching for issues labeled “good first issue,” “beginner,” or “help wanted.”](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/3USP2tdHLbLfWtfdUooupL/6b4fa6c0582be168b011514b1b91d94a/2-MCPsearchIssues_0.webp)

### Build, edit, debug, and refactor code locally

Copilot CLI edits files, runs commands, and helps you iterate fast without ever leaving your local environment.

Lines 9–13 show CSS properties, with line 12 highlighting a change from 'background-color: #e8f5e8;' (in red) to 'background-color: #4CAF50;' (in green). A prompt below asks whether to edit the file, offering options: 1. Yes, 2. Yes, always allow, 3. No, and tell Copilot what to do differently (Esc).](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/32HhI7gV6BFBswG8lg2drt/cf0fd16e70702e7eefa8845fb58043a8/3-ChangeColor_0.webp)

### Get started in seconds

Setup is a breeze. Install Copilot CLI and run your first command.

#### Does Copilot CLI support subagents or multi-agent workflows?

Subagents are not available in the current Public Preview release, but they are part of our planned roadmap for future releases.

#### How does chat history and session persistence work?

Copilot CLI maintains session persistence within and across sessions, allowing you to build on previous conversations and maintain context throughout your development workflow.

#### Will Copilot CLI integrate directly into VS Code?

Direct integration into VS Code is not available in the current Public Preview release, but it is being considered in our roadmap for future releases.

#### Security & Governance

#### How does Copilot CLI handle security and compliance?

Copilot CLI automatically inherits your organization's existing Copilot governance policies. It's built on GitHub's trusted platform infrastructure with the same security standards and compliance that protect millions of developers.
